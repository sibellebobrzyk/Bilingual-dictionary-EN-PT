This project is a bilingual dictionary application developed with Python. The application allows users to manage their vocabulary interactively, with features such as:

1) Add new words: Users can save words in Portuguese and English along with their meanings.
2) Search words: A search bar allows users to find words in the dictionary by language or meaning.
3) Data persistence: Words are stored in an Excel file (dictionary.xlsx), which is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

The app is ideal for students and anyone looking to expand their Portuguese and English vocabulary.
